Write a query to identify the top 2 Power Users who sent the highest number of messages on Microsoft Teams in August 2022. Display the IDs of these 2 users along with the total number of messages they sent. Output the results in descending order based on the count of the messages.

Assumption:

No two users have sent the same number of messages in August 2022.
messages Table:
Column Name	Type
message_id	integer
sender_id	integer
receiver_id	integer
content	varchar
sent_date	datetime
messages Example Input:
message_id	sender_id	receiver_id	content	sent_date
901	3601	4500	You up?	08/03/2022 00:00:00
902	4500	3601	Only if you're buying	08/03/2022 00:00:00
743	3601	8752	Let's take this offline	06/14/2022 00:00:00
922	3601	4500	Get on the call	08/10/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
sender_id	message_count
3601	2
4500	1
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution
To find the top 2 Power Users who sent the most messages on Microsoft Teams in August 2022, we need to first determine the count of messages sent by each user, which we'll refer to as "senders".

We start by extracting the month and year from the sent_date field and filtering the results to only include messages sent in August 2022. We then use the GROUP BY clause to group the messages by sender_id and calculate the count of messages using the COUNT() function:

SELECT 
  sender_id,
  COUNT(message_id) AS count_messages
FROM messages
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sent_date) = '8'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) = '2022'
GROUP BY sender_id;
You can learn more about the EXTRACT() function here, and about the GROUP BY clause here.

Here's the output from the query:

sender_id	count_messages
2520	3
3601	4
4500	1
The output of this query will provide the count of messages for each sender as shown in the example table.

Since we assume that no two users have sent the same number of messages in August 2022, we can simply use an ORDER BY clause in descending order to sort the results based on the count of messages.

Finally, we use a LIMIT clause to restrict the results to only the top 2 senders, giving us the desired outcome.

SELECT 
  sender_id,
  COUNT(message_id) AS count_messages
FROM messages
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sent_date) = '8'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) = '2022'
GROUP BY sender_id
ORDER BY count_messages DESC
LIMIT 2;

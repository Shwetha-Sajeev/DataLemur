This is the same question as problem #3 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership for mobile devices as mobile_views.

Effective 15 April 2023, the solution has been updated with a more concise and easy-to-understand approach.

viewership Table
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
device_type	string ('laptop', 'tablet', 'phone')
view_time	timestamp
viewership Example Input
user_id	device_type	view_time
123	tablet	01/02/2022 00:00:00
125	laptop	01/07/2022 00:00:00
128	laptop	02/09/2022 00:00:00
129	phone	02/09/2022 00:00:00
145	tablet	02/24/2022 00:00:00
Example Output
laptop_views	mobile_views
2	3
Explanation
Based on the example input, there are a total of 2 laptop views and 3 mobile views.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution
To calculate the viewership on different devices (laptops vs. mobile devices), we can utilize the aggregate function COUNT() along with the FILTER clause to apply conditional expressions.

SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE conditional_expression)
FROM table_name;
In the given example, the device types 'tablet' and 'phone' are considered as 'mobile' devices, while 'laptop' is treated as a separate device type.

The following query can be used to obtain the desired result:

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type = 'laptop') AS laptop_views,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone'))  AS mobile_views 
FROM viewership;
In the first column laptop_views, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type = 'laptop') calculates the count of rows where the device type is labeled as 'laptop'.

In the second column mobile_views, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone')) counts the number of rows where the device type is a tablet or a phone.

The result would have two columns, laptop_views and mobile_views displaying the respective counts of views for each device type.

laptop_views	mobile_views
2	3
Solution #2: Using SUM() & CASE statement

SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_views, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views 
FROM viewership;

Alibaba
You're trying to find the mean number of items per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal place using tables which includes information on the count of items in each order (item_count table) and the corresponding number of orders for each item count (order_occurrences table).

items_per_order Table:
Column Name	Type
item_count	integer
order_occurrences	integer
items_per_order Example Input:
item_count	order_occurrences
1	500
2	1000
3	800
4	1000
There are a total of 500 orders with one item per order, 1000 orders with two items per order, and 800 orders with three items per order."

Example Output:
mean
2.7
Explanation
Let's calculate the arithmetic average:

Total items = (1*500) + (2*1000) + (3*800) + (4*1000) = 8900

Total orders = 500 + 1000 + 800 + 1000 = 3300

Mean = 8900 / 3300 = 2.7

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution
Step 1: Calculate the weighted average of items per order
To calculate the weighted average of items per order, we multiply each item_count with the corresponding number of occurrences order_occurrences, calculate the sum using SUM(item_count * order_occurrences), and finally divide it by the total number of orders using SUM(order_occurrences).

SELECT 
  SUM(item_count*order_occurrences)
    /SUM(order_occurrences) AS mean
FROM items_per_order;
However, it's important to note that both item_count and order_occurrences are of integer type by default, which means that division will return an integer result. To ensure that the output is rounded to 1 decimal place, we can cast either column to a decimal type using ::DECIMAL or CAST(field AS decimal).

SELECT 
  SUM(item_count::DECIMAL*order_occurrences)
    /SUM(order_occurrences) AS mean
FROM items_per_order;
Step 2: Round results to 1 decimal place
To round the result to 1 decimal place, we can use the ROUND(__,1) function.

SELECT 
  ROUND(
    SUM(item_count::DECIMAL*order_occurrences)
    /SUM(order_occurrences)
  ,1) AS mean
FROM items_per_order;

CVS Health
CVS Health is analyzing its pharmacy sales data, and how well different products are selling in the market. Each drug is exclusively manufactured by a single manufacturer.

Write a query to identify the manufacturers associated with the drugs that resulted in losses for CVS Health and calculate the total amount of losses incurred.

Output the manufacturer's name, the number of drugs associated with losses, and the total losses in absolute value. Display the results sorted in descending order with the highest losses displayed at the top.

pharmacy_sales Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
units_sold	integer
total_sales	decimal
cogs	decimal
manufacturer	varchar
drug	varchar
pharmacy_sales Example Input:
product_id	units_sold	total_sales	cogs	manufacturer	drug
156	89514	3130097.00	3427421.73	Biogen	Acyclovir
25	222331	2753546.00	2974975.36	AbbVie	Lamivudine and Zidovudine
50	90484	2521023.73	2742445.90	Eli Lilly	Dermasorb TA Complete Kit
98	110746	813188.82	140422.87	Biogen	Medi-Chord
Example Output:
manufacturer	drug_count	total_loss
Biogen	1	297324.73
AbbVie	1	221429.36
Eli Lilly	1	221422.17
Explanation:
The first three rows indicate that some drugs resulted in losses. Among these, Biogen had the highest losses, followed by AbbVie and Eli Lilly. However, the Medi-Chord drug manufactured by Biogen reported a profit and was excluded from the result.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution
Step 1: Calculate total profit or loss for each manufacturer
To determine the total profit or loss for each manufacturer, we can use the formula:

Total Profit/(Total Loss) = Total Sales - Total Cost of Goods Sold

where a positive value indicates profit and a negative value indicates a loss. The query would look like this:

SELECT
  manufacturer,
  drug,
  total_sales - cogs AS net_value
FROM pharmacy_sales;
Showing the output for 4 randomly selected drugs:

manufacturer	drug	net_value
Biogen	Acyclovir	-297324.73
AbbVie	Lamivudine and Zidovudine	-221429.36
Eli Lilly	Dermasorb TA Complete Kit	-221422.17
Biogen	Medi-Chord	672765.95
This query will provide a result with the net_value column showing the calculated profit or loss for each drug.

Step 2: Filter for drugs making losses
To filter for drugs that are making losses, we can add a WHERE clause to keep rows where the total_sales - cogs is equal to or less than 0, indicating a loss:

SELECT
  manufacturer,
  drug,
  total_sales - cogs AS net_value
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE total_sales - cogs <= 0;
This query will return only the rows where the drug is making a loss.

Step 3: Obtain count of unprofitable drugs and total losses for each manufacturer
Next, we can use aggregate functions to obtain the count of drugs associated with each manufacturer using COUNT() and the total losses suffered by each manufacturer using SUM():

SELECT
  manufacturer,
  COUNT(drug) AS drug_count,
  SUM(total_sales - cogs) AS total_loss
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE total_sales - cogs <= 0
GROUP BY manufacturer;
Step 4: Convert total loss to absolute value and sort output
To convert the total losses to absolute value (i.e., remove the negative sign), we can use the ABS() function on the SUM(net_value) and order the results with the highest losses at the top:

SELECT
  manufacturer,
  COUNT(drug) AS drug_count,
  ABS(SUM(total_sales - cogs)) AS total_loss
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE total_sales - cogs <= 0
GROUP BY manufacturer
ORDER BY total_loss DESC;
Solution #2: Without ABS()

Alternatively, we can achieve the same result without using the ABS() function by switching the cogs and total_sales positions in the SUM() function and filtering for rows where cogs > total_sales in the WHERE clause:

SELECT
  manufacturer,
  COUNT(drug) AS drug_count, 
  SUM(cogs - total_sales) AS total_loss
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE cogs > total_sales
GROUP BY manufacturer
ORDER BY total_loss DESC;
